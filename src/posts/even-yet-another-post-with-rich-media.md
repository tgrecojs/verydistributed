# Using GitHub Gist as a tool for managing work items

I start my workday like I start _all_ workdays â€“ by spending about 15 minutes planning out my day. Iâ€™m willing to bet that many software developers, especially those of us who are working remotely, start the day in a similar way.

I imagine that the percentage of us who feel like we've _mastered_ this system is pretty small, but it's not for lack of trying! I've been all over the (cyber) world looking for the "perfect" tool. For me, a "perfect" tool is one that:

- Lets me quickly jot down a work plan and specific tasks, and easily edit the list anytime.
- Makes it easy to aggregate information on past workdays.
- Lets me easily share what I'm working on today, or what I've worked on before.
- I can amend throughout the day (and ideally see what amendments have been made)

I donâ€™t need two-way linking, or to embed video content. I donâ€™t need a customizable color palette, or the freedom to choose the font that fits my aesthetic. Basically, I don't need (or want) the latest cross-platform application, because it always leads to the same cycle:

I always end up spending way too much time learning the tool, only to abandon it (and all my notes) a week or two later.

I know it's just the first day of trying this, but I'm genuinely hopeful that I might have found a solution. At the very least, I have some content to put out into the world that:

A. I believe readers might find value in.
B. Only took me 20 minutes or so to write.

And I think that might mean I'm onto something! Like everything else, though, we'll just have to wait and see. ðŸ™‚

Let's see how it goes!
